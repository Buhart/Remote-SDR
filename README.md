# Remote-SDR
Remote-SDR remotely controls a SDR receiver and a SDR transmitter from a web browser. Pre-configured for the QO-100 Es'Hail 2 satellite transponder. Can be used for any NBFM, SSB or CW Radio from 1MHz up to 6 GHz. It can works in full duplex with Adalm-Pluto SDR, HackRF One, RTL-SDR or SA818.
Signal processing is done using gnuradio-companion and javascript. It runs on 1 or 2 Orange Pi One Plus single board computers under Armbian operating system to drive the SDRs. It runs also now on an Orange Pi Zero 2 with Armbian (Bullseye). It runs since version 2.4 on Raspberry 4 using Rasperry Pi OS.


Release v4.0 introduces the new Raspberry OS (Bullseye) for the Raspberry Pi 4B.

Release v4.1 introduces CW signal processing and automatic CW manipulator.

Release 4.2 introduces audio equalizers and noise filters.

Release 4.3 provides additional audio input/output to connect to external software (SSTV, FT8, Digi Modes..)

Release 4.4 allows IP ports selection to use Remote SDR via a NAT (Network Address Translation)
